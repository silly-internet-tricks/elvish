# Exercism Elvish Track

Exercism exercises in Elvish

This is a work in progress. The following exercises are completed:

- anagram
- darts
- leap
- resistor-color
- robot-simulator
- two-fer
- hello-world
- pangram
- pig-latin
- raindrops
- scrabble

To get started, download and install the Elvish Programming Language from https://elv.sh/

The site also has all the learning materials needed to learn to use the language.

Once Elvish is installed, you can use the `elvish` command in your terminal to open the shell program.

To run the tests locally, I am using this repo: https://github.com/silly-internet-tricks/elvish-test

Install the test runner from the other repo by running the following in your Elvish shell:

```Elvish
use epm
epm:install github.com/silly-internet-tricks/elvish-test
```

After cloning this repository, to try the Hello World exercise as an example, first go to the exercises/practice/hello-world directory and then use the command `elvish local-test-helper.elv` to run the tests. Edit the hello-world.elv file to fix the failing tests and solve the exercise. Then this process can be repeated for the other exercises from the list of completed exercises. Have fun!
