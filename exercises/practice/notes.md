# NOTES

## Each individual exercise will require all of the following:

1. a test file <slug>.test.elv
2. a local test helper file (which makes use of my "elvish-test" runner)
3. (in .docs) instructions.md (copied straight over from bash)
4. (in .meta) an example solution
5. (in .meta) config.json
6. (in .meta) tests.toml (generated using `configlet`) (not 100% positive that it's strictly required)
7. a solution stub file


## Optional file:

1. (in .docs) introduction.md (copied straight over from bash)
