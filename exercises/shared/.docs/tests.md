# Tests

To run the tests run the command `elvish local-test-helper.elv` from within the exercise directory.

The local test helper depends on a testing utility which can be installed from the Elvish prompt by using these commands:

```Elvish
use epm
epm:install github.com/silly-internet-tricks/elvish-test
```
